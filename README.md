# Studying Machine Learning: Deep Learning with TensorFlow/Keras.
Projects build while studying Deep Learning and Neural Networks (more specifically with TensorFlow and Keras. Might try some NeuralNets from Scratch after).

Project 03 also includes the local Dataset used for the project. ALL credits for the Dataset goes to https://github.com/mrdbourke (course autor who made a "subset" of the Food101 Dataset) and to the folks who made the Food101 Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101
